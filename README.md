# Car Sales Data Analysis ðŸš—ðŸ“Š  

## Overview  
This repository contains a dataset on car sales across different models, dealers, and months. The dataset includes details like quantity sold, profits, and dealer performance. The objective is to analyze sales trends, identify high-performing dealers and models, and extract business insights.

## Dataset Details  
- **File Name:** `CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx`  
- **Columns:**  
  - `Year` - Year of sale  
  - `Month` - Month of sale  
  - `Date` - Sales date (numeric format)  
  - `Model` - Car model name  
  - `Dealer ID` - Unique ID for each dealer  
  - `Quantity Sold` - Number of cars sold per dealer/model  
  - `Profit` - Revenue generated per sale  

## Analysis Goals  
- Identify **best-selling models** across different years/months  
- Analyze **profit trends** by car model and dealer  
- Determine which dealers have **the highest sales volumes**  
- Generate **data visualizations** for better insights  

## Tools & Techniques  
This dataset can be analyzed using:
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- **SQL** for querying key trends  
- **Power BI/Tableau** for interactive dashboards  

## How to Use  
1. Download the dataset from this repository.  
2. Use a **Jupyter Notebook or Python script** to clean and analyze the data.  
3. Visualize trends using **matplotlib/seaborn**.  
4. Share findings with an insightful **report or dashboard**.  

## Next Steps  
I plan to extend this repository by:
- Creating **data visualizations** to highlight key trends  
- Building a **dashboard** in Power BI/Tableau  
- Applying **machine learning models** for predictive analysis
